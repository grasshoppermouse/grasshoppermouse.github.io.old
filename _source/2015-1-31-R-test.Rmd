This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
asp.cluster = cld(asp.wide[asp.wide$sex=='female',], timeInData=3:16, time=seq(15,80,5))
kml(asp.cluster)
plot(asp.cluster, parTraj=parTRAJ(col="clusters"))
asp.wide$cluster = getClusters(asp.cluster, 2)
```
